A Machine Learning system designed to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions by identifying hidden patterns in real-time credit card data
Credit Card Fraud Detector is a binary classification system that identifies unauthorized transactions. In a world where "fake" transactions look almost identical to "real" ones, this project uses Machine Learning to detect the subtle anomalies that signal fraudulent behavior.
